# Coding evolution
#### :construction: WORK IN PROGRESS :construction:	

----

This repository wouldn't exist without the video that inspired it, 
[I programmed some creatures. They Evolved.
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3tRFayqVtk&t=905s) by David Randall Miller.

-----
The main idea is to simulate evolution using a neural network. This is currently a work in progress, and i will update the README as the code is more refined (and doing what it's supposed to do).

Both libraries used are for rendering the map (numpy and CV2).
